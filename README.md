#Serve-A-Gorilla
After creating an account, users can create or take any survey. 

Creating a survey requires the user to include at least one question. A question must have at least two options. More questions and options can be added. A created survey is visible to all other users. Once a survey is created, it cannot be edited, but it can be deleted.

Taking a survey requires the user to answer all questions. 

A user can only take a survey once. The creator of a survey can take their own survey. User responses are stored and aggregated to form bar graphs for each question of a survey. 

A user can easily navigate to a list surveys they have not created or already taken, ordered by the number of respondents. A user can easily navigate to a list of surveys they have created. A user can easily navigate to a list of surveys they have taken. 

A visitor can view the results of any survey, but will be prompted to login if they try to create or take a survey.

Sinatra and Thin on the backend, Twitter Bootstrap on the frontend.
